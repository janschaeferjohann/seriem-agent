# seriem-agent Rationale

## Purpose

Build a general-purpose agent that can create, read, update, and delete Serie M/ resources from concept workspaces, starting with the highest value resource types.

## Context

Resource authoring work today requires intensive expert effort and coordination across multiple artefacts. Implementations at customer sites often consume hundreds or thousands of person-days, making automation leverage-rich.

## Business Impact

Reducing manual effort in core resource operations creates a strong competitive advantage. Allowing a competitor to reach this capability first would be materially risky to the business.

## Feasibility and Priority

Modern LLM-based agent frameworks appear mature enough to build a helpful system. Resource operations (Templates, Models, Datamodels, Datamappings, FormIO, StyleCollections, Testdata, Testcases) are expected to benefit from AI before other domains, so this initiative leads the roadmap.
